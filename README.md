**Jumon** is a client-side technique which enables a social media link in a touchscreen browser to open in the respective social media app (instead of in the browser).

**Jumon** is a concise javascript which undertakes 3 steps:

 1. **Jumon** determines if the current device is a touchscreen device
 2. **Jumon** determines if the current touchscreen device is running iOS or Android
 3. **Jumon** swaps out the https:// web-protocol-based URL in the link for the app-specific protocol

When clicked, the link will now open in the respective social media app instead of in the touchscreen browser.
