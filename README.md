# Jumon

**Jumon** is a client-side technique utilising `JSON` and `Javascript` which enables a social media link in a touchscreen browser to open in the respective social media app (instead of in the browser).

**Jumon** is a concise script which proceeds through 3 sequential steps:

 1. **Jumon** determines if the current device is a touchscreen device
 2. **Jumon** then determines if the current touchscreen device is running iOS or Android
 3. **Jumon** then swaps out the `https://` web-protocol-based URL in the link for the app-specific protocol

When clicked, the link will now open in the respective social media app instead of in the touchscreen browser.
